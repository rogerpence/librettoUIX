## LibrettoXUI

Microsoft introduced WPF in 2006. I dabbled with it briefly then but never wrote anything beyond "Hello, world." Other shiny balls got my attention and I never returned to WPF, until the other day. 

This WPF app puts a user interface over a Python command-line code generator I wrote. The generator and its command line interface work just fine. However, a point-and-click way to use it would be sure be nice. And, while I'm at it, a way to store a code generation "set" to return later would sure be nice. That's what this little WPF app does.

I strongly suspect that despite my best efforts to write this little naively, my WPF techniques remain naive and crude. But the app goes the job.
